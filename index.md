# What’s the point of this guide?

Imagine being dropped in the middle of a new city and being handed a pamphlet that was able to infuse all of the knowledge, history, and sentiment of a local into your brain, without having to figure it all out slowly yourself. 

My goal with this guide is to give you the current state of Cardano and what all of us actively in the community take for granted as “common knowledge” and drop it straight into your brain to orient yourself in the ecosystem as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

**This guide is not meant to be exhaustive by any means, but to give you a quick overview of all the major sectors of and major players in the Cardano ecosystem to helped you get involved quickly with a basic understanding.**

This guide also aims to accomplish this goal simultaneously whether you are a complete newbie interested in Cardano wanting to get started or are already a crypto familiar person but native to another blockchain. 

This may cause some confusion among complete beginners reading through this, but I promise it’ll get easier the more you read and get involved in the ecosystem and community as I describe at the end. 

# Why Cardano?

When asked to explain what the point of Cardano is in 280 characters or less, Cardano Founder and IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson made this explanation: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cardano is an open platform that seeks to provide economic identity to the billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value and governance</p>&mdash; Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1290058248347770880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
 While I could write a whole article about that topic, I think this encompasses the sentiment of why many of us in the community so strongly support Cardano and it’s mission. It is a blockchain to change the many entrenched systems of the world and is for everyone, all 7 billion of us. 

# Cardano, ADA, and Tokens

Before we continue, I want to clarify a few terms that are used interchangeably in crypto, including within the Cardano ecosystem itself: 

Cardano is the name of blockchain and the project as a whole. 

Ada is the Native Token of the Cardano blockchain, the base transaction unit. 

Projects building on Cardano can/have created myriad of other Tokens for different use cases. These tokens reside on the base ledger like Ada, in contrast to other blockchains which need smart contracts to accomplish the same functionality. This also increases security guarantees.   

# How to Buy

Cardano, like many cryptocurrencies, can be easily bought and sold through most crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, FTX, Binance, and many more.

# Self Custody and Wallets

By default cryptos purchased on exchanges are stored there, and therefore under the custody of that exchange.

You may choose to leave it under that exchanges control (I.e. dollars in a bank) or send it off the exchange into a Cardano wallet (I.e. dollars in a house safe or a hole in your backyard)

However, in order to interact with all that the Cardano ecosystem as to offer, a Cardano wallet will be needed. 

Two of the most popular wallets to take full advantage of interaction with Cardano’s Decentralized Applications (dApps) are listed below: 

Eternl (Eternl.io) - Eternl wallet is an easy-to-use light wallet used developed by the Eternl team and loved by many in the community. It can be used for simple transactions, smart contract transactions, and staking. 

Nami (namiwallet.io) - Nami Wallet is another easy-to-use light wallet developed by Alessandro Konrad and love in the community. It can also be used for simple transactions, smart contract transactions, and staking with the Berry pool. 

These will allow you to connect and interact with all the following DeFi Protocols, NFT Marketplaces, and stake your Ada. More on these in the following sections. 

If you want to run a Cardano full node wallet, Cardano has those too: 

Daedalus (daedaluswallet.io) - Although Daedalus can’t interact with dApps like the above mentioned, it stores and verifies the full Cardano blockchain locally. This is in contrast to the lite wallets above that reference other servers with a copy of the Cardano blockchain instead of your device. 

After choosing a wallet, each platform will have steps and instructions on how to set them up securely and best practices around maintaining them. ALWAY REMEMBER TO STORE YOUR SEED PHRASES IN A SAFE PLACE AND NEVER SHARE THEM WITH ANYONE.

# NFTs on Cardano

Culturally, artistically, and utility-wise NFTs are used much the same way as other blockchain ecosystems. They allow users to create, buy, sell, and collect digital art and collectibles. NFT use cases will continue to expands into gaming, authorization systems, and many, many other utilitarian cases. 

However, there is one huge difference compare to some others: on Cardano NFTs (just like fungible tokens mentioned earlier) are native to the base Cardano ledger, giving them largely the same security guarantees as Cardano’s native token Ada itself. 

This is in contrast to many other blockchains which accomplish these token technologies with the use of complicated smart contracts instead, which also reduces security guarantees. 

## Marketplaces

NFT marketplaces are dApps that allow users to connect their wallets and buy NFTs, typically after mint being sold by other users. Following are some of the top players in the marketplace business:

JPG.store (jpg.store) - JPG.store is responsible for the vast majority of NFT sales on Cardano, and has a very simple, easy to us UX. 

Artifct (artifct.app) - Artifct is a popular marketplace that is geared towards artistic, rather than the typical collectible NFT, audiences. 

## NFT Projects

Now what is the point of knowing the NFT market places without knowing some of the established Cardano NFT projects and currently popular projects. I have giving a brief list of what I believe the general sentiment of the Cardano Community’s views of NFT projects in this section. This section is largely based of my view of the general sentiment and is subject to my bias. 

If you get more interested in the NFT sector of Cardano (or any blockchain really) you’ll notice people become much more emotional and attached to their projects, and it is important to be aware of this. 

Again, the goal is to give you a sample of what the NFT world looks like rather than an exhaustive list. Get more involved, and you can make you own choices and purchases that make you happy or align with your interests. 

## Household Name Projects

SpaceBudz (spacebudz.io) - Spacebudz are the first 10k series of NFTs on Cardano and widely considered the pinnacle NFT of Cardano. Created by Alessandro Konrad, also found of Berry stakepool and contributor to many open source Cardano projects. 

Berry (berrypool.io) - Berries were the first created NFTs on Cardano, with only 100 minted and given to delegators of Alessandro Konrad’s BERRY stakepool. The Berry pool was also the first stakepool built on a Raspberry Pi.

Clay Nation by Clay Mates (claynation.io) - Clay Nation is a collection of 10,000 digital characters with algorithmically assembled, handcrafted clay traits. Each unique character is a one-of-a kind NFT, stored on the Cardano blockchain. Just like in the non-clay world, no two members of Clay Nation are the same.  

DEADPXLS [DING] (pxlz.org) - DEADPXLZ are the first interactive NFT collectibles on the Cardano blockchain, and were well know know for their unique and groundbreaking minting process.

Chilled Kongs (chilledkongs.com) - In today’s hectic world, Chilled Kongs is here to remind us of the value of taking a moment to chill, to hang with friends, or to just do whatever we love.

The Ape Society (theapesociety.io) - The Ape Societies 7,000 characters each have a unique design generated from a set of traits. Some attributes are rarer than others, but every ape has its own sense of style and purpose.

## Other Well Known Projects

The aim of this category of NFTs is to showcase talked about and known NFT projects in the community, though they may not have earned the title of “household” name or might be historically or communally significant but without the volume or popularity that accurately reflects it. 

Clay Nation x Good Charlotte (claynation.io) - CN X GC is an exciting collaboration between the Clay Nation team and the 2000s rock band Good Charlotte, fusing their unique clay sculpting skills with a combination of punk rock and Halloween inspired stylings. 

Yummi Universe [YUMMI] (yummiuniverse.com) - Yummi Universe plans to bring creatures like Pokemon and Digimon to Cardano in a universe that encourages players to battle together, trade with each other and most of all, have fun. 

Unsigned_algorithms (unsigs.com) - The first algorithmically generated art living on Cardano. Mathematically derived and designed, generated using computers and advanced algorithms, it is one of the largest NFT series, with each piece having a unique look and feel.

Disco Solaris (discosolaris.com) - A story-driven 80s retrotopia on Cardano, based in the city of Neo Miami. This project has created a large community around itself and an ever developing lore. 

Mocossi (mocossi.com) - The first play-to-earn virtual pet game on the Cardano blockchain. 

Old Money (oldmoney.io) - Old Money is self described as “A premature monument to paper currency.” This creative project takes the likeness of the US dollar bills and puts their own graffiti-like touch to each NFT. 

Cardano Trees (cardanotrees.com) - Cardano Trees are the first fully unchain evolutive art trees living and growing in Cardano. These NFTs change each day and season and are based in different locations around the world. 

## Metaverse and Land Projects

Metaverse and Land projects hold promises of virtual worlds where you can interact with others. These types of projects are generally consider more speculative because of the massive amount of effort that it will take to create these and are typically long term projects.

Pavia [PAVIA] (pavia.io) - Pavia is the first and largest metaverse project by land count (100,000) parcels on the Cardano blockchain. 

Pitches at Clay Nation (claynation.io) - Pitches at Clay Nation is our upcoming virtual festival environment. It will be an inclusive space to hang out and explore experimental surroundings built on and moulded together with its population: you.

Cornucopia [COPI] (cornucopias.io) - Cornucopias 'The Island' is a massive Play-To-Earn, Build-To-Earn, and Learn-To-Earn blockchain based game where players can be rewarded with and/or own land, properties and other NFT based assets with real-world value all by playing games in a fun and safe Metaverse.

Cabins by the Ape Society (theapesociety.io) - Cabins are your interactive virtual economy, game rooms, and cigar lounge for your Ape Society Apes. 

## Payment Domains

Not all NFTs are art or collectibles, and much of the future utility of NFT technology will be separate from those use cases. 

Ada Handle (adahandle.com) - Ada Handle is a fantastic showcase of how NFT technology can be used to make life easier on-chain. Ada Handles are an NFT that a user can hold in their wallet that allows transactions to be received using a unique, human-readable $handle rather than the long and complicated addr1… addresses typically used. 

## Data Aggregates

Curious about NFT prices or love collecting rare traits? Two of the best sites that collect and compile NFT data are:

OpenCNFT (opencnft.io) - Great for tracking NFT sales volume, floor prices, and more.

CNFTJungle (cnftjungle.io) - Great for viewing NFTs by different rarity traits and finding wherever they maybe for sale. 

## Creating NFTs

NFT-MAKER [NMKR] (nft-maker.io) - NFT-MAKER is the premier product on the Cardano blockchain for creating and minting NFTs and their metadata, with many more services to come. 

# DeFi on Cardano

While Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is still getting started on Cardano, many projects are currently live, with many more planning to go live through the summer. Below I have listed some of the most well know projects in the DEX, Lend/Borrow, Stablecoin, and Staking/Token Distribution categories. 

## DEXes 

Cardano currently has many working Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes). These DEXes allow swapping between native token Ada and other fungible project tokens (examples in square brackets below) without a centralized power (I.e. bank/exchange) having custody of the funds and trades. Rather it all takes place through Smart Contracts and code. Listed below are some of the most popular choices: 

Minswap [MIN] (minswap.org) - Minswap is currently the most popular DEX on Cardano and provides a very smooth user experience for trading. They also allow for providing liquidity and yield farming. 

SundaeSwap [SUNDAE] (sundaeswap.finance) - SundaeSwap was the first AMM style DEX live on Cardano and paved the way for many projects and Cardano protocol upgrades. It still provides a good user experience for swapping. They also allow for providing liquidity and yield farming. 

MuesliSwap [MILK] (muesliswap.com) - MuesliSwap was the first DEX to go live on Cardano, featuring fixed order book style trading. It is still a fan favorite. 

Wingriders [WRT] (wingriders.com) - Wingriders is a DEX that integrates with the Milkomeda EVM compatible side chain, which allows swaps with both native assets and sidechain assets. They also allow for providing liquidity and yield farming. 

Maladex [MAL] (maladex.com) - Maladex is being held up to be the most heavily researched and top of the line DEXes on release later this year. 

## Lend/Borrow Protocols 

Cardano has a few Lend/Borrow protocols on the rise, soon to be released this summer. Lend/borrow protocols are exactly what they sound like: these dApps will allow users to either lend funds and earn interest rates on those funds, or put up collateral and borrow funds in a decentralized manner. Listed below are some of the heavy hitters in the space: 

Liqwid [LQ] (liqwid.finance) - Liqwid Finance will allow for both lending and borrowing of Ada, and other assets. Users will be rewarded with interest rates and distributions of its LQ token. It’s biggest claim to fame is its 4x sources of Yield from one lending deposit. Check out its site for more details. 

Aada [AADA] (aada.finance) - Aada Finance will allow for both lending and borrowing of Ada, and other assets. Users will be rewarded with interest rates and distributions of its AADA token.

MELD [MELD] (meld.com) - MELD Finance will allow for both lending and borrowing of Ada, and other assets. Users will be rewarded with interest rates and distributions of its MELD token.

## Stablecoin Protocols 

Cardano has also has a few stablecoins and stablecoin protocols on the rise, many aiming for a summer release. These projects will create the first native stablecoins on Cardano, as well as stablecoin swaps and stablecoin yields. Stablecoins are an important part of any crypto ecosystem, as they allow for protecting funds from the volatility of the general market and typically lower, less risky returns. 

Ardana [DANA] (ardana.org) - Ardana will be a platform for a specialized stablecoin swap, optimized for low slippage, and ways to earn yield on those stablecoins. It will also include its own stablecoin DUSD. 

LiquidX [LQUSD] (liqwidx.org) - LiqwidX is a branch of the Liqwid finance project and team. It will allow users to borrow LQUSD against ADA at 0% interest.

DJED [DJED] (djed.xyz) - DJED will be an algorithmic stablecoin, and at a high level will be over collateralized by Ada and it’s backing token SHEN. DJED is based off an IOG academic paper and is being implemented by the company COTI. 

## ISPOs and Token Distributions

Due to Cardano’s unique non-custodial staking mechanism, there has evolved interesting and risk free way for projects to bootstrap funds, while simultaneously being able to reward early believers in a project. This has been called Initial Stake Pool Offerings. 

This technique, first described by SundaeSwap, involves a project setting up a stakepool where early believers can stake their Ada allowing the project to reap the Ada rewards to fund themselves, while those staking receive tokens of the project (essentially airdrops). All of this while the Ada never leaves their wallet. 

There has been one project that has expanded upon this idea of project token distribution, given it more flexibility, allow projects to skip making their own distribution code, and made it possible if projects do not want to create their own pool. 

DripDropz [DRIP] (dripdropz.io) - DripDropz allows projects to distribute their tokens to whatever audience parameters they choose (I.e. certain stakepools only, certain token holders, outside parameters, etc). 

# Community and Learning Resources:

I can guarantee I will be missing accounts, sites, and servers below, but I believe I have listed many great sources for information and community building to get you started. 

## Twitter Accounts to Follow:

## Discord Servers: 

I’m not going to list any specific Discord servers here. The best discord servers are the ones where you are actually interested in the project and want to have conversations and back and forth with other people. I recommend going to each website or Twitter page of any project you’re interested in and joining the Discord from there. 

## Informational Sites:

- Pool.pm (pool.pm) - Track live minting of blocks, NFTs, and FTs. Check load on the chain as well. 

- PoolTool (pooltool.io) - Very comprehensive site for staking statistics and info. Track staking rewards very accurately.

- DefiLlama (defillama.io) - Total Value Locked (TVL) Aggregator for all blockchains including Cardano

# Final Words

Much of what I’ve listed are just limited tastes of what each category has to offer, and I hope this document just serves as a kick start to your Cardano journey and learning more about what you like and want out of the ecosystem. 

There are many more projects and protocols than the ones I have listed above, both good and bad. The more interaction with the ecosystem and community you do, the more you can learn, discover, and do. It is up to you to always do your due diligence and exercise best judgement. 

The best way to learn more and become more involved in the Cardano Ecosystem is to check out the projects sites, read project white papers, join Discords to chat with people, and join Twitter to enjoy its chaos and knowledge. 

Good luck, and have fun!

P.S. I will try to update this periodically, so it is always a decent representation of how to get started in the Cardano ecosystem at whatever current state it is in.
